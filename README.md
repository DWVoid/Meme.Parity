# Meme.Parity

For the meme! <br/>
Tests whether a u32 integer from the console is even or odd using a compressed bitmap as lookup table.

## How to use

Build and run the `Execute` project. 
Input a u32 number into the console and then press enter.
Result will be displayed on the next line.

If you want to regenerate the table, 
build and run `Generate` instead and look for `LUT` in the output directory.
